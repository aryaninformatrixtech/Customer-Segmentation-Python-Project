Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a larger group of customers into smaller, more specific groups based on similar 
characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. It helps businesses understand their customers better and tailor their marketing strategies
to different segments. By segmenting customers, companies can target their products, services, and messages to specific groups, 
increasing the chances of success. It allows businesses to focus their resources effectively and provide personalized experiences 
that resonate with different customer segments. Ultimately, customer segmentation helps companies build stronger relationships 
with their customers and drive business growth
